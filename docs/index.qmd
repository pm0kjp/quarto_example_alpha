## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## GitHub

We'll be using GitHub to make a published slide deck. There are other ways to do this, too, but this might be the easiest, and requires no additional account setups.

## Create a New Repository

* Create a new repository in GitHub, and clone it to your desktop.
* Make a new folder called "docs"

## Create a New R Project 

* Create a new R Project in an existing directory (the one you just set up)
* Open in new Session

## Create a New Quarto Presentation

* Change any yml
* Save it with a useful name (`index.qmd` is particularly good)
* Render and take a peek!

## Add Support Files

* Add a `.gitignore` with `.Rproj*/*` and (if on a Mac) `.DS_Store`
* Add an empty file called `.nojekyll`

## Push to GitHub

* Push changes to GitHub
* Make GitHub Pages changes ("docs", main)

## Improve your slides with R / Markdown

* Add formatting
* Add code (example: countdown timer!)
* Add images

## Add special stuff

Quarto-specific:

* Speaker notes
* Layout
